# ProjectMicrowave
Winter 2020 Project - Microave Radio Path Web Site

An application that helps telecommunication engineering company yo design microwave communication systems. Created in LAMP Stack using PHP, AJAX, JavaScript, SQL

<h2>The project consists of three parts</h2>
<h3>Part1</h3>
1. Define the needed database
2. Upload microwave path data in a CSV format text file to the web
server

<h3>Part2</h3>
1. Edit the data for a selected microwave path.

<h3>Part3</h3>
1. Perform the necessary calculations to determine the usability of a
microwave path
2. Path Attenuation
3. Apparent terrain/obstruction heights based on the curvature of the
earth
4. First Freznel Zone
5. Display the results of the path calculations in a tabular format, and where
appropriate in a graphical format.
